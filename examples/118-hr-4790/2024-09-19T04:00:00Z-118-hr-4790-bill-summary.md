The combined legislative efforts of the "Prioritizing Economic Growth Over Woke Policies Act" and the "American FIRST Act of 2023" aim to reshape U.S. financial regulations with a focus on economic growth, transparency, and investor protection. Here's a comprehensive overview of the main objectives and provisions of these bills in layman's terms:

### Key Objectives:

1. **Streamlining Corporate Disclosures**: Both bills emphasize simplifying the information companies must share with investors, focusing on what's truly important for investment decisions. This means companies will only need to disclose information that significantly impacts an investor's choice, reducing the burden of unnecessary disclosures.

2. **Reducing Non-Economic Influences**: The legislation seeks to minimize the impact of political or social issues, such as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, on corporate governance and investment decisions. Companies can exclude ESG-related shareholder proposals, and investment decisions should prioritize financial benefits.

3. **Enhancing Proxy Voting and Corporate Governance**: The bills introduce reforms to the proxy voting process, ensuring that votes are cast based on informed decisions rather than automatic recommendations from advisory firms. This includes specific rules for passively managed funds and mandates for proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC for greater transparency.

4. **Protecting Retail Investors**: Financial advisors and brokers are required to prioritize the financial interests of retail investors, using clear financial factors in their recommendations. Any non-financial considerations must be disclosed and agreed upon by the investor.

5. **Strengthening U.S. Financial Sovereignty**: The legislation aims to ensure that U.S. financial regulations are not unduly influenced by international organizations. It requires scrutiny of international policies before they are adopted in the U.S. and mandates reporting on interactions with global financial bodies.

6. **Improving Regulatory Oversight and Accountability**: The bills call for studies and reports on various aspects of financial regulation, including the impact of climate change disclosures and the effectiveness of rules on municipal securities. They also seek to prevent executive overreach and ensure congressional oversight of financial stability recommendations.

7. **Structural Reforms in Financial Supervision**: Changes include restructuring supervisory roles within the Federal Reserve and limiting the SEC's ability to deposit certain fees into its Reserve Fund for specified fiscal years.

### Overall Impact:

These legislative efforts aim to prioritize economic growth by focusing on material financial factors, enhancing transparency and accountability in financial regulations, and protecting the interests of investors. By reducing the influence of non-economic factors and ensuring that U.S. financial institutions operate independently from international pressures, the bills seek to create a more robust and investor-friendly financial environment.
