The "End Woke Higher Education Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to reinforce and protect constitutional rights, particularly focusing on free speech, freedom of association, and religious rights within higher education institutions. Here’s a breakdown of the bill’s main objectives and provisions in straightforward terms:

1. **Accreditation Standards**: The bill prohibits accrediting agencies from imposing political or ideological requirements on colleges and universities. This means that institutions cannot be forced to adopt specific political views or treat people differently based on protected characteristics, unless required by federal law.

2. **Religious Freedom**: Institutions with religious missions are allowed to maintain their religious practices and standards, including requiring adherence to faith-based codes of conduct.

3. **Free Speech and Association**: The bill emphasizes the importance of free speech on campuses by encouraging the adoption of principles that support open inquiry and expression. It opposes the use of political tests in hiring or admissions processes and ensures that students and faculty are informed about their rights to free speech and association.

4. **Student Organizations**: The bill outlines protections for student organizations, ensuring they can be recognized even without a faculty advisor and that they have access to fair funding and security arrangements for events. It also protects the rights of religious and single-sex organizations to operate without discrimination.

5. **Legal Framework and Enforcement**: The bill provides a legal pathway for individuals or organizations to sue institutions that violate these rights. It includes measures for revoking and restoring eligibility for federal programs if institutions fail to comply with the outlined standards.

6. **Transparency and Accountability**: Institutions must disclose their free speech policies to students and faculty and provide educational programming on these rights. They are also required to report violations and corrective actions to the Secretary of Education and Congress.

7. **Violence and Safety**: The bill clarifies that acts of violence on campuses are not protected by the First Amendment and underscores the importance of maintaining a safe environment for free expression.

Overall, the "End Woke Higher Education Act" seeks to ensure that higher education institutions respect and uphold constitutional rights, particularly focusing on preventing political bias and protecting free speech and religious freedoms on campuses.
