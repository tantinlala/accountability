The bill, H. Res. 1469, passed by the House of Representatives, serves as a formal expression of the House's position on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. It has several key objectives:

1. **Condemnation of the Administration**: The resolution strongly criticizes the Biden-Harris administration for its handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. It highlights a series of perceived failures, including prioritizing political considerations over security, ignoring the Taliban's non-compliance with the Doha Agreement, and inadequate planning for the evacuation of noncombatants.

2. **Accountability**: The bill holds President Biden, Vice President Harris, and other high-ranking officials accountable for the negative outcomes of the withdrawal. It points to the chaos during the evacuation, the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. servicemembers, and the abandonment of American citizens, Afghan allies, and military equipment.

3. **Impact on National Security**: The resolution argues that these actions have harmed U.S. national security and international standing, suggesting that the administration's approach has had long-term detrimental effects.

4. **Policy Stance and Encouragement**: While the resolution primarily focuses on condemnation, it also reflects the House's stance on the issue and may encourage other governmental bodies or the public to take actions aligned with this perspective.

Overall, the resolution is a formal statement of disapproval regarding the administration's conduct during the Afghanistan withdrawal, emphasizing accountability and the perceived impact on U.S. interests.
