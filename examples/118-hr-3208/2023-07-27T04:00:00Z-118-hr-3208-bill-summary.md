The bill seeks to modify the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by introducing a new initiative called the "DHS Cybersecurity On-the-Job Training Program." This program is designed to provide practical, hands-on training in cybersecurity for employees within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as well as potentially other federal employees. The main goal is to improve the cybersecurity skills and capabilities of these individuals, thereby bolstering the overall cybersecurity strength of the DHS.

Key components of the bill include:

1. **Program Development**: The program will be developed and led by a Director, who will work alongside the Under Secretary for Management. Together, they will create a curriculum that aligns with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Framework, using a variety of teaching methods to ensure comprehensive training.

2. **Eligibility and Training**: The Director will establish criteria for who can participate in the program and will oversee the delivery of cybersecurity training to eligible DHS employees and possibly other federal workers.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The Director is required to submit annual reports to relevant congressional committees for seven years. These reports will include data on the number of participants, job placements after training, success metrics, and other pertinent information.

4. **Role of the Under Secretary**: The Under Secretary for Management will be responsible for reporting on cybersecurity job vacancies, supporting recruitment efforts for the program, implementing policies to encourage participation, and conducting outreach to promote job opportunities for participants after they complete the training.

5. **Legislative Amendment**: The bill includes a clerical amendment to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to formally incorporate this new training program.

Overall, the bill aims to create a structured pathway for developing cybersecurity expertise within the DHS, ensuring that employees are well-equipped to handle the evolving challenges in the cybersecurity landscape.
