The "Future Uses of Technology Upholding Reliable and Enhanced Networks Act," or the "FUTURE Networks Act," is a legislative proposal aimed at advancing the development and implementation of sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology in the United States. The bill directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a "6G Task Force" within 120 days of the bill's enactment. This task force will be composed of representatives from trusted communications companies, public interest organizations, academic institutions, and various government levels.

The main objectives of the FUTURE Networks Act are to explore the potential of 6G technology, address its challenges, and facilitate its integration into the national infrastructure. The task force is tasked with producing a comprehensive report within one year, detailing the current status of industry standards, potential applications, and limitations of 6G technology, including supply chain and cybersecurity concerns. The report will also outline strategies for collaboration among government entities to effectively leverage 6G technology.

To ensure transparency and public involvement, a draft report will be published within 180 days for public comment, which will be considered in the final report. The bill also includes definitions of key terms, such as "not trusted" entities, which are those identified as national security threats by the FCC Chair.

Overall, the FUTURE Networks Act seeks to position the United States as a leader in the next generation of wireless technology by fostering innovation, ensuring security, and promoting collaboration across sectors.
