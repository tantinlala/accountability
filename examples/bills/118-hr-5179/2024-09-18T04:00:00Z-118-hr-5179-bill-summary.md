The "Anti-BDS Labeling Act" (H.R. 5179) is a legislative proposal focused on maintaining the current U.S. policy regarding how products made in the West Bank or Gaza are labeled in terms of their country of origin. Specifically, it seeks to ensure that these goods continue to be marked according to the guidelines set by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as of December 23, 2020. The bill's main goal is to preserve transparency and accuracy in the labeling of these products, so consumers are clearly informed about where they originate.

A significant provision of the bill is that it prevents any federal funds from being used to change or cancel this labeling policy unless Congress decides to do so through new legislation. This means that the existing labeling rules will stay in place unless there is a specific legislative action to alter them. The bill underscores the importance of maintaining consistent labeling practices for goods from these regions, although it may also address other related issues not detailed in the provided summaries.
