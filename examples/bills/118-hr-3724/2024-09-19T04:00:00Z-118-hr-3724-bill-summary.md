The "End Woke Higher Education Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to reinforce and protect constitutional rights, particularly focusing on free speech, freedom of association, and religious rights within higher education institutions. Here’s a breakdown of the bill’s main objectives and provisions in straightforward terms:

1. **Accreditation Standards**: The bill seeks to prevent accrediting agencies from imposing political or ideological requirements on colleges and universities. It ensures that institutions are not forced to adopt specific political viewpoints or treat individuals differently based on protected classes, except where required by federal law.

2. **Religious Freedom**: Institutions with religious missions are allowed to maintain their religious practices and standards, including requiring adherence to faith-based codes of conduct.

3. **Free Speech and Association**: The bill emphasizes the importance of free expression and open dialogue on campuses. It encourages institutions to adopt principles that support free speech and prohibits political litmus tests in admissions and employment decisions.

4. **Disclosure Requirements**: Colleges and universities must disclose their policies on free speech, association, and religion to students and faculty. This includes detailing any limitations on speech and ensuring transparency in how student organizations are recognized and funded.

5. **Student Organizations**: The bill outlines protections for student organizations, ensuring they are not denied recognition due to the lack of a faculty advisor and that they have access to fair funding and appeals processes. It also protects the rights of religious and single-sex organizations.

6. **Legal Framework and Enforcement**: The bill provides a legal pathway for individuals or organizations to challenge violations of these provisions in federal court. Institutions found in violation may lose eligibility for federal programs but can regain it by demonstrating compliance.

7. **Violence and Safety**: The bill clarifies that acts of violence on campuses are not protected by the First Amendment and emphasizes the need for safety standards for invited speakers and guests.

8. **Reporting and Accountability**: Institutions must report violations and corrective actions to the Secretary of Education, who will also report annually to Congress. Acceptance of federal funding implies a waiver of state immunity for related legal actions.

Overall, the "End Woke Higher Education Act" aims to create a balanced environment in higher education where free speech and religious freedoms are protected, while ensuring transparency and fairness in institutional policies and practices.
