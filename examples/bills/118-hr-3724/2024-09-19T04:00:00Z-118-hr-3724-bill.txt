                    ``(A) recognizes that free expression, open 
                inquiry, and the honest exchange of ideas are 
                fundamental to higher education;
                    ``(B) acknowledges the profound contribution of the 
                Chicago Principles to the freedom of speech and 
                expression; and
                    ``(C) calls on nonsectarian institutions of higher 
                education to adopt the Chicago Principles or 
                substantially similar principles with respect to 
                institutional mission that emphasizes a commitment to 
                freedom of speech and expression on university campuses

                accordingly.
            ``(2) Political litmus tests.--The Congress--
                    ``(A) condemns public institutions of higher 
                education for conditioning admission to any student 
                applicant, or the hiring, reappointment, or promotion 
                of any faculty member, on the applicant or faculty 
                member pledging allegiance to or making a statement of 
                personal support for or opposition to any political 
                ideology or movement, including a pledge or statement 
                regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion, or related 
                topics; and
                    ``(B) discourages any institution from requesting 
                or requiring any such pledge or statement from an 
                applicant or faculty member, as such actions are 
                antithetical to the freedom of speech protected by the 
                First Amendment to the Constitution.
    ``(b) Construction.--Nothing in sections 112B through 112E shall be 
construed to infringe upon, or otherwise impact, the protections
