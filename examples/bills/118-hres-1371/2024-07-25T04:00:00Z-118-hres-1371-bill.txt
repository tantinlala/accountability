H. Res. 1371

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         July 25, 2024.
Whereas, on March 24, 2021, President Biden tasked Vice President Kamala Harris 
        with working to address illegal immigration into the United States, 
        including ``root causes'', and came to be known colloquially as the 
        Biden administration's ``border czar'';
Whereas it took Vice President Kamala Harris 93 days as the border czar before 
        finally visiting the southern border on June 25, 2021;
Whereas when Vice President Kamala Harris traveled near the southern border for 
        the first time on June 25, 2021, she decided to travel to El Paso, 
        Texas, 800 miles away from the lower Rio Grande;
Whereas former United States Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz stated that during 
        his two years in the position, ``I've never had one conversation with 
        the president [Biden] or the vice president [Harris], for that matter. I 
        was the Chief of the Border Patrol, I commanded 21,000 people. That's a 
        problem.'';
Whereas current United States Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens stated that Vice 
        President Kamala Harris has not spoken with him since he was appointed 
        in July 2023;
Whereas, since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, there have been over 9.7 
        million illegal immigrant encounters nationwide;
Whereas, since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, there have been over 7.9 
        million illegal immigrant encounters at the United States southern 
        border;
Whereas, since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, there have been roughly 
        2 million known gotaways who evaded the United States Border Patrol;
Whereas this number represents more known gotaways than in the previous decade 
        combined;
Whereas, in May 2024, there were 170,723 illegal immigrant encounters at the 
        United States southern border, a 185 percent increase from the average 
        May encounter total under President Trump;
Whereas May 2024 was the 39th straight month where monthly illegal immigrant 
        encounters have been higher than even the highest month seen under 
        President Trump;
Whereas illegal immigrants with violent criminal histories who have murdered 
        innocent Americans like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungary, Rachel Morin, and 
        others throughout the United States, pose an existential threat to the 
        safety and security of the American people;
Whereas, in June 2024, NBC News reported that over 400 illegal immigrants with 
        ties to an ISIS-affiliated smuggling network entered the United States 
        under Border Czar Harris's leadership, and that the whereabouts of over 
        50 of these individuals were unknown;
Whereas, under Border Czar Harris's leadership, multiple illegal aliens with 
        terrorist ties have been released into the United States;
Whereas, to date in fiscal year 2024, there have been a record-breaking 31,077 
        Chinese nationals encountered at the southwest border;
Whereas the Biden border crisis is costing the United States approximately 
        $150.7 billion each year and each taxpayer $1,156 each year;
Whereas, in April 2024, Republicans on the House Committee on Homeland Security 
        released documents showing the Biden administration, under Border Czar 
        Harris, flew at least 400,000 illegal immigrants into the country 
        through the abuse of parole programs; and
Whereas President Biden's and Border Czar Harris's far left Democrat open border 
        policies are to blame for this historic crisis, and in August 2022, 
        Biden and his administration decided to make the border crisis 
        significantly worse by formally ending former President Trump's 
        successful Remain in Mexico program: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) strongly condemns the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, 
        Kamala Harris's, failure to secure the United States border;
            (2) affirms that the American people deserve elected officials who 
        understand the gravity of the crisis at the border and who will execute 
        the policies to fix the border crisis; and
            (3) clearly and firmly states that the continuation of the Biden, 
        Harris border policies would be disastrous for both the United States 
        and the American people.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
