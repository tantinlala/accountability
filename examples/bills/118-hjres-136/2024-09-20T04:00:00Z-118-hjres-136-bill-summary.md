The main goal of the joint resolution H.J. Res. 136 is to officially express Congress's disapproval of a specific rule put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule involves setting new emissions standards for cars and trucks, specifically targeting light-duty and medium-duty vehicles that will be manufactured in 2027 and beyond. Essentially, the resolution aims to cancel or invalidate this EPA rule, meaning it would no longer be applicable or enforceable. In simpler terms, Congress is attempting to block the implementation of these new emissions standards proposed by the EPA for future vehicles.
