_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
To provide that sanctuary jurisdictions that provide benefits to aliens 
 who are present in the United States without lawful status under the 
 immigration laws are ineligible for Federal funds intended to benefit 
                              such aliens.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities 
Act''.

SEC. 2. SANCTUARY JURISDICTION DEFINED.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided under subsection (b), for 
purposes of this Act, the term ``sanctuary jurisdiction'' means any 
State or political subdivision of a State that has in effect a statute, 
ordinance, policy, or practice that prohibits or restricts any 
government entity or official from--
            (1) sending, receiving, maintaining, or exchanging with any 
        Federal, State, or local government entity information 
        regarding the citizenship or immigration status (lawful or 
        unlawful) of any individual; or
            (2) complying with a request lawfully made by the 
        Department of Homeland Security under section 236 or 287 of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) to 
        comply with a detainer for, or notify about the release of, an 
        individual.
    (b) Exception.--A State or political subdivision of a State shall 
not be deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction based solely on its having a 
policy whereby its officials will not share information regarding, or 
comply with a request made by the Department of Homeland Security under 
section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1226 and 1357) to comply with a detainer regarding, an individual who 
comes forward as a victim or a witness to a criminal offense.

SEC. 3. SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS INELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN FEDERAL FUNDS.

    Beginning on the earlier of the date that is 60 days after the date 
of enactment of this Act or the first day of the fiscal year that 
begins after the date of enactment of this Act, a sanctuary 
jurisdiction is ineligible to receive any Federal funds that the 
sanctuary jurisdiction intends to use for the benefit (including the 
provision of food, shelter, healthcare services, legal services, and 
transportation) of aliens who are present in the United States without 
lawful status under the immigration laws (as such terms are defined in 
section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act).

SEC. 4. REPORT ON NONCOMPLIANCE.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to 
the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a report that includes a list 
of States, and political subdivisions of States, that have failed to 
comply with requests described in section 2(a)(2).

            Passed the House of Representatives September 20, 2024.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
