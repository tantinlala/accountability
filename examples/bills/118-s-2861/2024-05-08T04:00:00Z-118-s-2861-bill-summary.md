The "Billie Jean King Congressional Gold Medal Act" is a legislative proposal to honor Billie Jean King, a trailblazer in sports and a champion for equal rights, by awarding her a Congressional Gold Medal. This bill acknowledges her extraordinary contributions to both sports and society, particularly her efforts in promoting gender equality.

Billie Jean King is celebrated for her illustrious tennis career, which includes 39 Grand Slam titles, and her pivotal role in advancing women's rights in sports. She played a crucial part in the enactment of Title IX, ensuring equal funding for women's and men's sports programs. King also founded the Women's Tennis Association and the Virginia Slims Series to elevate women's tennis and advocate for pay equity. Her victory over Bobby Riggs in a landmark match highlighted women's capabilities in sports and furthered the cause of gender equality.

Beyond tennis, King established the Women's Sports Foundation and the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, both aimed at fostering diversity and equality. Her legacy is commemorated through various honors, such as the renaming of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and the Billie Jean King Cup. Her influence extends beyond sports, serving as a beacon of inspiration for gender equality and empowerment.

The bill authorizes the creation of a Congressional Gold Medal featuring King's image and name, designed and produced by the Secretary of the Treasury. Bronze duplicates of the medal may be sold to offset production costs, with proceeds supporting the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. This act not only celebrates King's achievements but also reinforces her enduring impact on American society and the ongoing fight for equal rights.
