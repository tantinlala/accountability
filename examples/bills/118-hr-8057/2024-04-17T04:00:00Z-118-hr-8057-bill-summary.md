The bill H.R. 8057 proposes to rename the United States Postal Service facility at 9317 Bolsa Avenue in Westminster, California, as the "Little Saigon Vietnam War Veterans Memorial Post Office." The main objective of this bill is to honor and recognize the contributions and sacrifices of Vietnam War veterans. Once enacted, all official U.S. documents will refer to this postal facility by its new name, serving as a lasting tribute to these veterans within the community.
