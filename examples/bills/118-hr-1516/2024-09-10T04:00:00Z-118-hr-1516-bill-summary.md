The "DHS Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern Act" is a legislative proposal designed to regulate the influence of certain Chinese-affiliated programs and entities on U.S. higher education institutions. The main goal of the bill is to prevent these institutions from receiving funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) if they maintain relationships with Confucius Institutes or other specified Chinese entities.

Key provisions of the bill include:

1. **Definitions**: The bill clearly defines important terms such as "Chinese entity of concern," which refers to Chinese universities and organizations involved in activities that may undermine U.S. interests, including military-civil fusion and defense. It also defines "Confucius Institute," "institution of higher education," "relationship," and "Thousand Talents Program."

2. **Funding Restrictions**: U.S. higher education institutions that have ties with Confucius Institutes, the Thousand Talents Program, or other Chinese entities of concern will be prohibited from receiving DHS funds. To qualify for DHS funding, these institutions must terminate any such relationships.

3. **Reporting Requirement**: The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress on any institutions that have these relationships and are receiving DHS funding.

Overall, the bill seeks to limit the influence of Chinese government-affiliated programs on U.S. educational institutions by leveraging DHS funding as a means of ensuring compliance.
