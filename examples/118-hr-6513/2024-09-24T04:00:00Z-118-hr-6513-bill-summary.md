The "Confirmation Of Congressional Observer Access Act of 2024" (COCOA Act of 2024) is a legislative measure designed to enhance transparency and integrity in U.S. federal elections. It amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to formally establish the role of congressional election observers. These observers are designated employees from the House or Senate who are authorized to monitor election activities, particularly in situations where elections are contested.

The main objectives of the COCOA Act are to ensure that these observers have the right to access and observe all aspects of election administration during congressional elections. This includes being present at polling locations and overseeing processes such as ballot casting, processing, and certification. The bill mandates that states must allow these observers full access to observe election procedures, but it strictly prohibits them from handling ballots, advocating for any candidates, or interfering with the election process. Observers are allowed to ask questions to clarify procedures but must do so without causing disruptions.

If an observer is found to be engaging in misconduct and is removed, the bill allows for a replacement to be sent to continue the observation duties. The term "State" in the bill encompasses all U.S. states and territories, ensuring nationwide applicability.

Additionally, the bill includes provisions for enforcement and updates to the clerical aspects of the Help America Vote Act's table of contents, ensuring that the legislative framework is clear and up-to-date. Overall, the COCOA Act of 2024 aims to bolster the transparency and integrity of the electoral process by confirming and formalizing the role of congressional election observers.
