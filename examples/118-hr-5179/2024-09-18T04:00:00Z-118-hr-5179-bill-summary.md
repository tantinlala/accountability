The "Anti-BDS Labeling Act" (H.R. 5179) is a legislative proposal focused on maintaining the current U.S. policy regarding how goods imported from the West Bank or Gaza are labeled in terms of their country of origin. Specifically, it seeks to ensure that the labeling rules established by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on December 23, 2020, remain unchanged unless Congress decides to alter them. This means that products from these regions will continue to be marked as originating from the West Bank or Gaza, as per the existing guidelines.

A significant provision of the bill is the prohibition of using federal funds to change or cancel this labeling policy. This effectively means that no government resources can be used to modify the current country of origin marking requirements for goods from these areas unless there is a new legislative decision by Congress. The bill's primary goal is to preserve the status quo regarding these labeling practices, potentially in response to broader geopolitical considerations, such as the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, although the bill does not explicitly mention these factors.
