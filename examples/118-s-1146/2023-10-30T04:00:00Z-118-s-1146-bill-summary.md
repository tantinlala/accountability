The "Find and Protect Foster Youth Act" is a legislative effort aimed at improving the safety and well-being of children in the foster care system, particularly those who go missing or are at risk of sex trafficking. The bill amends part E of title IV of the Social Security Act, focusing on several key objectives and provisions:

1. **Identification and Response Improvement**: The Act mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify and address obstacles that hinder the recognition and response to reports of missing foster children and other vulnerable youth. This involves evaluating state and tribal protocols to ensure they are effective and compliant.

2. **Technical Assistance**: The Secretary is tasked with providing technical assistance to states, Indian tribes, and relevant organizations. This includes offering information, advice, educational materials, and tools to improve risk assessment, runaway tracking, and intervention strategies.

3. **Screening and Support for At-Risk Youth**: The bill emphasizes the need for improved screening processes to identify children who return to foster care after being missing, particularly those at risk of or victims of sex trafficking. It encourages documentation of findings and the provision of appropriate services.

4. **Policy and Procedure Enhancement**: The Act supports the development and modification of policies and procedures, including training for caseworkers, to better address the needs of at-risk children. This includes creating oversight mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Social Security Act.

5. **Data Utilization**: States and organizations are encouraged to use collected data for oversight and compliance purposes, ensuring that the information is effectively used to protect foster youth.

6. **Expert Consultation**: The Secretary is encouraged to consult with experts on sex trafficking to inform the development and dissemination of assistance to relevant entities.

Overall, the "Find and Protect Foster Youth Act" seeks to enhance the protection and safety of foster children by improving the systems and processes that identify and support those who are missing or at risk, with a particular focus on preventing sex trafficking.
