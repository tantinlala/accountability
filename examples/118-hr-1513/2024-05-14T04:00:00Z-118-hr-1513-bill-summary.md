The "Future Uses of Technology Upholding Reliable and Enhanced Networks Act," or the "FUTURE Networks Act," is a legislative proposal focused on advancing the development and implementation of sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology in the United States. The bill mandates the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create a "6G Task Force" within 120 days of the bill's enactment. This task force will be composed of representatives from trusted communications companies, public interest organizations, academic institutions, and various government levels.

The main goal of the 6G Task Force is to produce a detailed report on 6G technology within one year of its formation. This report will assess the current status of industry standards, explore potential applications and limitations of 6G technology, and address issues such as supply chain and cybersecurity concerns. Additionally, the report will propose strategies for collaboration among government entities to effectively leverage 6G technology. A draft version of the report will be made available for public comment within 180 days before the final report is completed.

The bill also includes provisions to define key terms, such as "not trusted" entities, which refer to those considered national security threats by the FCC Chair. Overall, the FUTURE Networks Act aims to ensure that the United States is at the forefront of 6G technology development, addressing both opportunities and challenges associated with its implementation.
