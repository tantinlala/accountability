The "Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act" is a proposed amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act, focusing on enhancing the criteria for determining which non-citizens (aliens) are inadmissible to or deportable from the United States based on certain criminal activities. The main objectives of the bill are to protect individuals, particularly women, from violence by ensuring that those who have committed specific crimes are not allowed to enter or remain in the country. Here’s a breakdown of the bill’s key provisions in simple terms:

1. **Sex Offenses**: The bill seeks to prevent individuals who have been convicted of, or have admitted to, committing sex offenses from entering the United States. This includes offenses defined by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, as well as any conspiracy to commit such offenses.

2. **Domestic Violence and Related Crimes**: It expands the list of crimes that can make a person inadmissible to include domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, neglect, abandonment, and violations of protection orders. This means that individuals who have committed these crimes would not be allowed to enter the U.S.

3. **Deportability for Sex Offenses**: The bill establishes that individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses, or have conspired to commit them, can be deported from the United States.

4. **Clarification on Domestic Violence Crimes**: It clarifies that crimes related to domestic violence, as defined by existing law, are grounds for deportation. This applies regardless of whether the crime is connected to any specific grant funding.

Overall, the bill aims to strengthen the U.S. immigration system by ensuring that individuals who pose a threat due to past criminal behavior, particularly related to violence against women and children, are either prevented from entering or are removed from the country.
