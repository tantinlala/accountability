The "Protect America's Innovation and Economic Security from CCP Act of 2024" is a legislative effort designed to protect U.S. innovation and economic interests from potential threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The bill establishes the CCP Initiative within the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. This initiative focuses on several key areas:

1. **Intellectual Property Protection**: The bill aims to curb espionage activities targeting U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions, ensuring that American innovations are safeguarded from foreign interference.

2. **Cybersecurity Enhancement**: It emphasizes the need to bolster cybersecurity measures to protect against hacking and economic espionage, particularly from nontraditional technology collectors.

3. **Economic Integrity**: The initiative will enforce the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act to scrutinize investments by Chinese companies, ensuring they do not compromise U.S. economic security.

4. **Legal Enforcement**: The bill prioritizes the prosecution of trade secret theft and other forms of economic espionage. It also involves identifying and addressing cases under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that involve Chinese companies.

5. **Coordination and Reporting**: The Attorney General will work with the FBI and other agencies to implement these measures, with the initiative operating independently and having its own resources. An annual report detailing progress, challenges, and coordination efforts will be submitted to Congress.

The act includes a sunset clause, expiring six years after enactment, but contains a severability clause to ensure that if any part of the act is found unconstitutional, the rest remains effective. Passed by the House of Representatives on September 11, 2024, the bill represents a comprehensive approach to protecting U.S. economic and innovation interests from foreign threats, particularly those associated with the CCP.
