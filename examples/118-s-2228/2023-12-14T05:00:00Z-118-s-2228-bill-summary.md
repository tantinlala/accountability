The "Building Chips in America Act of 2023" is a legislative proposal designed to facilitate the growth of the semiconductor manufacturing industry in the United States by amending existing environmental review processes. The bill specifically targets the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to streamline the approval process for semiconductor production projects that receive federal financial assistance. Here are the main objectives and provisions of the bill in simple terms:

1. **Streamlined Environmental Reviews**: The bill aims to make it easier and faster for semiconductor manufacturing projects to get through the environmental review process. This is done by redefining what counts as a "major Federal action" under NEPA, which typically requires extensive environmental assessments.

2. **Exemptions for Certain Projects**: Projects that receive federal financial help might be exempt from being classified as major federal actions if they meet certain conditions. For example, if a project starts by the end of 2024 or if the federal assistance is a loan or covers less than 10% of the project cost, it could bypass some of the usual environmental review requirements.

3. **Department of Commerce's Role**: The bill gives the Department of Commerce the primary responsibility to lead the environmental review process for these semiconductor projects, ensuring a more coordinated and efficient approach.

4. **Categorical Exclusions**: Certain activities, particularly those involving the National Institute of Standards and Technology, can skip detailed environmental assessments if they fall under predefined categories that are considered to have minimal environmental impact.

5. **Use of Existing Studies**: The bill allows for the use of previous environmental studies and decisions in the review process, provided they meet certain standards. This includes studies done under state or tribal laws that are as stringent as federal requirements, potentially reducing redundancy and saving time.

6. **Clarification of Terms**: To ensure everyone is on the same page, the bill clarifies key terms like "covered activity" and "NEPA," which helps in the consistent application of these new rules.

Overall, the "Building Chips in America Act of 2023" is focused on reducing bureaucratic hurdles for semiconductor projects, thereby encouraging domestic production and strengthening the U.S. semiconductor industry.
