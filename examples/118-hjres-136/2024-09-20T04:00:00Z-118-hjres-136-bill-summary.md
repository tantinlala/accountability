The main goal of the joint resolution H.J. Res. 136 is to officially express Congress's disapproval of a specific rule set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule involves setting new emissions standards for cars and trucks, specifically targeting models from the year 2027 onwards. The resolution aims to cancel this EPA rule, meaning it would not be legally valid or enforceable if the resolution is passed. Essentially, Congress is attempting to block the implementation of these new emissions standards proposed by the EPA for future vehicles.
