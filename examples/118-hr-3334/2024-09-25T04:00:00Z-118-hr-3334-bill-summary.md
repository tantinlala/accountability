The "Sanctioning Tyrannical and Oppressive People within the Chinese Communist Party Act" (STOP CCP Act) is a U.S. legislative proposal aimed at penalizing members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for actions considered oppressive or tyrannical. The bill targets individuals within the CCP, particularly those involved in human rights abuses and aggressive policies affecting Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Taiwan.

**Main Objectives and Provisions:**

1. **Sanctions on CCP Members**: The bill mandates the U.S. President to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the CCP and Chinese state-owned enterprises. These sanctions include blocking property transactions and denying entry visas to the U.S.

2. **Human Rights Concerns**: The bill addresses significant human rights issues, such as the repression of ethnic Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, including Uyghurs, which the U.S. has labeled as genocide. It also criticizes the Hong Kong National Security Law for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and violating international commitments.

3. **Support for Taiwan**: The bill emphasizes the importance of supporting Taiwan's security and maintaining strong U.S.-Taiwan relations in light of increased Chinese military and diplomatic pressure.

4. **International and U.S. Policy Alignment**: The bill aligns with international condemnation of China's actions, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to preventing genocide and supporting democratic entities like Taiwan.

5. **Sanction Exceptions and Waivers**: While the bill imposes strict sanctions, it allows for exceptions related to U.N. obligations and U.S. national security activities. The President can waive sanctions for national security reasons or terminate them if China ceases oppressive actions or if individuals renounce CCP membership and rectify their conduct.

Overall, the STOP CCP Act seeks to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its actions that undermine human rights and regional stability, while reinforcing U.S. commitments to international law and democratic allies.
