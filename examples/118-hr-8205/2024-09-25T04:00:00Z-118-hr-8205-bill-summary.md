The "Keeping Violent Offenders Off Our Streets Act" (H.R. 8205) is a legislative proposal designed to strengthen the integrity of the bail system in the United States by amending title 18 of the United States Code. The primary objective of the bill is to explicitly prohibit fraudulent activities associated with the posting of bail, which encompasses monetary bail, criminal bail bonds, and Federal immigration bail bonds. By targeting fraud in these areas, the bill aims to enhance legal measures that ensure the bail process is conducted fairly and transparently, thereby preventing violent offenders from exploiting loopholes to secure their release unlawfully. This legislative effort underscores a commitment to maintaining public safety by keeping potentially dangerous individuals off the streets through a more robust and fraud-resistant bail system.
