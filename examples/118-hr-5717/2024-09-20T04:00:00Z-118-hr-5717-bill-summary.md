The "No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act" is a proposed law designed to limit federal funding to certain areas known as sanctuary jurisdictions. These are places, like states or cities, that choose not to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Specifically, these jurisdictions might refuse to share information about someone's immigration status or ignore requests from the Department of Homeland Security to hold or release individuals based on their immigration status.

The bill's main goal is to ensure that these sanctuary jurisdictions do not receive federal funds that are meant to support undocumented immigrants. This includes money for essential services like food, shelter, healthcare, legal assistance, and transportation. However, there are exceptions in the bill for jurisdictions that protect crime victims or witnesses, ensuring they can still receive necessary support.

Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide an annual report to Congress. This report will list the states and local governments that are not complying with federal immigration enforcement requests. The idea is to increase transparency and accountability regarding which jurisdictions are not cooperating with federal immigration policies.

In summary, the bill seeks to financially penalize sanctuary jurisdictions by cutting off specific federal funds, while also increasing oversight and reporting on their compliance with immigration enforcement.
