The "Protecting Americans' Investments from Woke Policies Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at refining the rules governing retirement investment decisions in the United States. The bill seeks to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) with several key objectives and provisions, which can be summarized as follows:

1. **Prioritizing Financial Returns**: The bill emphasizes that fiduciaries, who are responsible for managing retirement plans, should focus on financial factors that are expected to materially impact investment risk or return. This means that when making investment decisions, fiduciaries should prioritize financial returns over non-financial (non-pecuniary) goals. However, if financial factors alone do not clearly favor one investment over another, fiduciaries may consider non-financial factors, provided they document their reasoning and ensure it aligns with the financial interests of plan participants.

2. **Non-Discrimination in Benefits**: The bill includes provisions to ensure that the selection and management of fiduciaries, advisors, and service providers for employee benefit plans are conducted without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. This aims to promote fairness and equality in the administration of retirement plans.

3. **Shareholder Rights and Proxy Voting**: The bill outlines fiduciary responsibilities related to managing shareholder rights, such as proxy voting, for retirement plan assets. Fiduciaries are required to act prudently and solely in the economic interest of plan participants. They must evaluate costs, consider material facts, and maintain records of proxy activities. The bill allows fiduciaries to adopt proxy voting policies, including safe harbor policies, which guide voting decisions based on economic interests and provide a framework for when to vote or abstain.

4. **Transparency for Retirement Investors**: The bill mandates enhanced transparency for participants using brokerage windows in retirement plans. Participants must receive a notice before investing in non-designated alternatives, informing them of potential higher risks and fees. The notice includes a hypothetical illustration of potential returns to aid in decision-making.

5. **Retirement Balance Projections**: The bill requires that participants receive projections of their retirement balances at age 67, based on different annual return rates (4%, 6%, and 8%). This aims to help participants better understand their potential retirement savings outcomes.

Overall, the bill seeks to ensure that retirement investment decisions are made with a clear focus on financial returns, promote non-discriminatory practices in plan management, protect shareholder rights, and enhance transparency and information for retirement investors. The amendments are set to take effect at various times, with some provisions starting as early as January 1, 2024, and others by January 1, 2025.
