The "Enhanced Presidential Security Act of 2024" is designed to improve the safety and security of key political figures in the United States. The main goals of the bill are to ensure that there are clear and consistent standards for how many Secret Service agents are needed to protect current and former Presidents, Vice Presidents, and major candidates for these offices. To achieve this, the bill requires the Director of the United States Secret Service to establish these standards.

Additionally, the bill mandates a thorough review of the Secret Service's current protection services for these individuals. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of existing security measures and identify any areas for improvement. The findings and recommendations from this review must be reported to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees within 180 days after the bill becomes law.

Furthermore, the bill provides a clearer definition of what constitutes "major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates" to ensure that the right individuals receive the necessary protection. Overall, the Act seeks to enhance the security framework for high-profile political figures, ensuring their safety through well-defined and evaluated protective measures.
