The "Next Generation Pipelines Research and Development Act" is a legislative effort aimed at modernizing the United States' pipeline infrastructure through enhanced research, development, and demonstration activities. The bill seeks to foster collaboration between public and private sectors, leveraging the expertise of various stakeholders, including higher education institutions, nonprofit research organizations, National Laboratories, and private companies.

**Key Objectives and Provisions:**

1. **Public-Private Partnerships**: The bill emphasizes the importance of collaboration between government entities and private sector partners to drive innovation in pipeline technologies.

2. **Research and Development Initiatives**: It establishes a Joint Research and Development Program within the Department of Energy, in partnership with the Department of Transportation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This program focuses on developing advanced materials and technologies for pipeline systems, with an emphasis on safety, reliability, and environmental sustainability.

3. **Demonstration Projects**: The bill supports pilot projects to test and validate new pipeline materials and technologies in real-world settings, ensuring their effectiveness and practicality.

4. **National Pipeline Modernization Center**: A center will be established to collaborate with industry and stakeholders on research and commercialization of cost-effective pipeline solutions. This center will work closely with existing energy-related research centers and prioritize training for pipeline safety inspectors.

5. **NIST Pipeline Metrology Program**: This program will focus on measurement research and standardization to ensure pipeline integrity and support safety and efficiency.

6. **Funding and Appropriations**: The bill authorizes significant funding to support these initiatives, with specific allocations for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management. It also extends funding authorizations for pipeline research and development activities through 2029.

7. **Coordination and Avoidance of Duplication**: The bill mandates coordination among various federal agencies to prevent duplication of efforts and ensure efficient use of resources.

8. **Focus on Underserved Areas**: The initiative aims to reduce environmental impacts, particularly in underserved regions, by advancing technologies that enhance pipeline safety and efficiency.

Overall, the "Next Generation Pipelines Research and Development Act" aims to modernize pipeline infrastructure by promoting innovation, enhancing safety, and reducing environmental impacts through strategic partnerships and targeted research efforts.
