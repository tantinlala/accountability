The "Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) Certification Act" is a legislative measure aimed at reassessing and potentially revoking the special privileges granted to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) in the United States. This bill is a response to concerns about Hong Kong's diminishing autonomy from the People's Republic of China and seeks to ensure that U.S. interactions with these offices align with American values and policies regarding human rights and autonomy.

**Main Objectives and Provisions:**

1. **Certification Process**: The President is required to evaluate and certify whether the HKETOs should continue to receive certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. This certification must be submitted to Congress within 30 days of the bill's enactment and annually thereafter.

2. **Privileges and Immunities**: The privileges in question are those granted under a 1997 Act, which are detailed in the bill. These privileges allow HKETOs to operate with certain diplomatic-like benefits in the U.S.

3. **Revocation and Termination**: If the President determines that HKETOs no longer merit these privileges, their operations must cease within 180 days. The President also has the authority to revoke these privileges at any time. If HKETOs terminate operations, the certification requirement ends.

4. **Congressional Oversight**: Congress has the power to disapprove the President's certification through a joint resolution, with specific procedures for consideration in both the House and Senate.

5. **Contracting Restrictions**: The bill imposes restrictions on U.S. government entities regarding agreements or partnerships with HKETOs. Before entering into such agreements, the President must certify that these offices deserve their privileges and that no disapproval resolution is enacted within 90 days.

6. **Human Rights and Autonomy**: The bill emphasizes the U.S. policy of not promoting Hong Kong as a free and autonomous city or its government as committed to human rights and the rule of law, as long as Hong Kong lacks autonomy from China. It aims to prevent U.S. entities from supporting Chinese propaganda about Hong Kong.

7. **Advocacy for Human Rights**: The bill encourages engagement with Hong Kong's government to advocate for the release of political prisoners, end arbitrary detentions, resume a free press, ensure fair elections, and restore an independent judiciary.

In summary, the HKETO Certification Act is designed to scrutinize and potentially limit the privileges of Hong Kong's trade offices in the U.S., contingent on Hong Kong's autonomy and human rights practices. It reflects a broader U.S. policy stance against supporting narratives that undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.
