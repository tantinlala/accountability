# Bill Summary
The bill seeks to update the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by introducing a new initiative called the "DHS Cybersecurity On-the-Job Training Program." This program is designed to provide practical, hands-on cybersecurity training to employees within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as well as potentially other federal employees, to better prepare them for roles in cybersecurity.

Key elements of the bill include:

1. **Program Leadership and Development**: The program will be overseen by a Director, who will work with the Under Secretary for Management to create a curriculum based on the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Framework. This curriculum will use a variety of teaching methods to ensure comprehensive training.

2. **Eligibility and Training**: The Director will establish criteria for who can participate in the program and will be responsible for delivering the training to eligible DHS employees and possibly other federal workers.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: For seven years, the Director must provide annual reports to certain congressional committees. These reports will include data on the number of participants, their job placements after training, and other success indicators.

4. **Role of the Under Secretary for Management**: This official will report on open cybersecurity positions, help recruit participants for the program, implement policies to encourage involvement, and promote job opportunities for participants after they complete the training.

5. **Legislative Update**: The bill also makes a clerical amendment to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to formally include this new training program.

Overall, the bill aims to strengthen the cybersecurity workforce within DHS by equipping employees with the necessary skills and knowledge through a structured training program.
