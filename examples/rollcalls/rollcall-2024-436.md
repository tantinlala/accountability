# Bill Summary
The "No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act" is a proposed law designed to limit federal funding to certain areas known as sanctuary jurisdictions. These are places, like states or cities, that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Specifically, these jurisdictions might restrict sharing information about someone's immigration status or not comply with requests from the Department of Homeland Security regarding immigration detainers.

However, the bill makes an exception for jurisdictions that have policies in place to protect victims or witnesses of crimes, meaning they won't be considered sanctuary jurisdictions if their non-compliance is solely for this reason.

The main goal of the bill is to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions do not receive federal funds meant to support undocumented immigrants. This includes funds for essential services like food, shelter, healthcare, legal services, and transportation. The restriction on funding would take effect 60 days after the bill becomes law or at the start of the next fiscal year.

Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide an annual report to Congress. This report would list the states and local governments that have not complied with federal immigration enforcement requests. The overall aim is to encourage jurisdictions to cooperate with federal immigration authorities by tying their compliance to the receipt of federal funds.
