# Bill Summary
The "Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at providing financial relief to U.S. nationals who are unlawfully detained or held hostage abroad and at curbing financial support for terrorism. The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with two main objectives:

1. **Financial Relief for Hostages and Wrongfully Detained Individuals**: 
   - **Postponement of Tax Deadlines**: The bill allows for the postponement of tax-related deadlines for U.S. nationals who are detained or held hostage abroad. This means that the time they spend in captivity will not count towards deadlines for filing taxes, paying taxes, or accruing interest and penalties.
   - **Application to Spouses**: These provisions also extend to the spouses of the affected individuals.
   - **Refunds and Abatements**: Any penalties, interest, or additional taxes that were assessed or collected from these individuals before they were identified as hostages or wrongfully detained will be refunded or abated.
   - **Program Establishment**: By January 1, 2025, a program will be established to facilitate the refund or abatement of penalties and fines for eligible individuals, covering tax liabilities incurred from January 1, 2021, to the enactment date of the bill.
   - **Identification and Notification**: The Secretary of State and the Attorney General will compile a list of eligible individuals, who will be notified of their eligibility for refunds or abatements within 90 days of their release or the enactment date.

2. **Termination of Tax-Exempt Status for Terrorist-Supporting Organizations**:
   - **Designation of Organizations**: The Secretary of the Treasury is empowered to designate organizations as "terrorist supporting" if they have provided significant material support to terrorist groups within the past three years.
   - **Suspension of Tax-Exempt Status**: Once designated, these organizations will lose their tax-exempt status, which will only be reinstated if the designation is rescinded.
   - **Notification and Opportunity to Cure**: Organizations will receive a notice before being designated, giving them 90 days to prove they did not support terrorism or to rectify their actions.
   - **Review and Rescission**: Designations can be reviewed administratively and judicially, and can be rescinded if found to be erroneous or if the organization did not receive proper notice.

Overall, the bill aims to alleviate the financial burden on U.S. nationals who are victims of wrongful detention or hostage situations abroad and to deter organizations from financially supporting terrorism by revoking their tax-exempt status.
