# Bill Summary
The "Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources Act" or "HEATS Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at simplifying the regulatory process for geothermal energy development. The bill seeks to amend the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 by reducing federal oversight for certain geothermal activities, particularly on non-federal lands. Here are the main points of the bill in straightforward terms:

1. **Simplified Permitting**: The bill allows geothermal operators to bypass the need for a federal drilling permit if the federal government owns less than half of the geothermal resources underground. Instead, operators can proceed with just a state-issued permit.

2. **Reduced Federal Oversight**: Activities that meet the criteria for permit exemption are not considered significant federal actions. This means they are not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which typically requires extensive environmental reviews. Additionally, these activities are exempt from the Endangered Species Act, though they must comply with the National Historic Preservation Act unless state laws already cover historic preservation.

3. **Royalties and Inspections**: The bill maintains the requirement for operators to pay royalties to the U.S. government for geothermal electricity production. It also ensures that the Secretary of the Interior can conduct inspections to ensure compliance and proper royalty payments.

4. **Exclusion of Indian Lands**: The bill explicitly states that its provisions do not apply to Indian lands or resources managed in trust for Indian Tribes. It provides a clear definition of what constitutes Indian land to avoid any ambiguity.

Overall, the HEATS Act aims to streamline the process for developing geothermal energy by reducing federal regulatory requirements, thereby encouraging more efficient and timely exploration and production of geothermal resources.
