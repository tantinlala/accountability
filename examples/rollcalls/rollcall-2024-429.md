# Bill Summary
The "Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act" is a proposed amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act, focusing on enhancing the criteria for inadmissibility and deportability of non-citizens based on specific criminal activities. The main goal of the bill is to protect individuals in the United States from violence and abuse by ensuring that non-citizens who have committed certain crimes are not allowed to enter or remain in the country. Here are the key provisions of the bill in simple terms:

1. **Inadmissibility for Sex Offenses**: Non-citizens who have been convicted of, or have admitted to, committing sex offenses, including those outlined in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, will not be allowed to enter the United States.

2. **Inadmissibility for Domestic Violence and Related Crimes**: Non-citizens who have been convicted of, or have admitted to, crimes such as domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, neglect, abandonment, or violating protection orders that involve threats or harm, will be barred from entering the country.

3. **Deportability for Sex Offenses**: Non-citizens who have been convicted of sex offenses, or have conspired to commit such offenses, will be subject to deportation from the United States.

4. **Expanded Definition of Domestic Violence for Deportability**: The bill broadens the definition of domestic violence for the purpose of deportation. This means that any crime that qualifies as domestic violence, regardless of whether it is linked to specific grant funding, can lead to deportation.

Overall, the bill aims to strengthen the immigration laws by ensuring that individuals who pose a threat due to their criminal history, particularly in relation to violence and abuse, are not permitted to enter or stay in the United States.
