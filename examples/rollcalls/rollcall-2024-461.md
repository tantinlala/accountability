# Bill Summary
The "Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2024" is a legislative effort to update and refine the way the United States identifies and manages materials essential for energy and strategic purposes. The main goal of this bill is to broaden the definition of what constitutes a "critical mineral" by including "critical materials" within this category. This change is intended to create a more consistent and comprehensive approach to classifying and handling these vital resources.

In practical terms, the bill modifies the Energy Act of 2020 by expanding the criteria for what can be considered a critical mineral. Now, not only minerals but also any element, substance, or material that the Secretary of Energy deems critical will be included. This means that the list of critical minerals will be more inclusive and reflective of current and future needs.

The bill also requires that this list be updated promptly—within 45 days—whenever the Secretary of Energy identifies a new critical material. This ensures that the classification of critical minerals remains current and responsive to changing technological and strategic demands.

Overall, the "Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2024" aims to enhance the United States' ability to manage and secure materials that are crucial for energy production and other strategic applications, thereby supporting national security and economic stability.
