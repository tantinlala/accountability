FAFSA Deadline Act

# Bill Summary
The "FAFSA Deadline Act" is a proposed bill aimed at improving the financial aid application process for students planning to attend college. The main goal of the bill is to ensure that students can start applying for federal student aid earlier, which can help them better plan for their educational expenses.

Currently, students can begin filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) starting January 1 of the year they plan to enroll in college. This bill proposes to move that start date up to October 1 of the previous year. This change is intended to give students and their families more time to understand their financial aid options and make informed decisions about college attendance.

To ensure this new timeline is met, the bill introduces two key requirements for the Department of Education:

1. **Certification Requirement**: By September 1 each year, the Secretary of Education must confirm to the relevant congressional committees that the Department is on track to meet the October 1 FAFSA application start date.

2. **Testimony Requirement**: If the Department anticipates it will not meet the October 1 deadline, the Secretary of Education must explain the reasons and potential financial impacts on students and families to the congressional committees by September 30.

Overall, the "FAFSA Deadline Act" seeks to streamline the financial aid process, providing students with earlier access to crucial information about their financial aid eligibility, thereby facilitating better planning for their higher education journey.
