# Bill Summary
The "No Foreign Election Interference Act" is a proposed U.S. law designed to prevent foreign influence in American elections by targeting certain tax-exempt organizations. Here's a breakdown of the bill's main objectives and provisions in simple terms:

1. **Purpose**: The bill seeks to stop foreign nationals from indirectly influencing U.S. elections by contributing to tax-exempt organizations that then donate to political committees.

2. **Penalties for Contributions**: If a tax-exempt organization receives money from foreign nationals and then donates to a political committee, it must pay a penalty. This penalty is twice the amount of the contribution made to the political committee.

3. **Disqualified Contributions**: A contribution is considered "disqualified" if the organization received any foreign national donations within the eight years before making the political contribution.

4. **Who is Affected**: The bill targets tax-exempt organizations with significant financial activity, specifically those with at least $200,000 in gross receipts or $500,000 in assets.

5. **Loss of Tax-Exempt Status**: If an organization makes more than two disqualified contributions, it will lose its tax-exempt status for any year after the third such contribution.

6. **Initial Leniency**: For the first three disqualified contributions, the organization will still be treated as tax-exempt for penalty purposes, providing a brief grace period.

7. **Implementation Date**: These rules will apply to contributions made on or after January 1, 2025.

Overall, the bill aims to close loopholes that could allow foreign money to influence U.S. elections through tax-exempt organizations, ensuring that political contributions are free from foreign interference.
