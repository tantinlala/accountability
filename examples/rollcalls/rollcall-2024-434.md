# Bill Summary
The "Prioritizing Economic Growth Over Woke Policies Act" is a proposed U.S. legislative measure designed to reform federal securities laws with a focus on economic growth and materiality in corporate disclosures. Here's a simplified overview of its main objectives and provisions:

1. **Materiality in Disclosures**: Companies are required to disclose only information that is materially significant to investors, meaning only details that could substantially influence investment decisions need to be shared.

2. **SEC Accountability**: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must justify any disclosure mandates that are not materially significant, aiming to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on businesses.

3. **Public Company Advisory Committee**: A new committee will be established to guide public company matters, focusing on investor protection, fair markets, and capital formation.

4. **Limiting Shareholder Proposals**: The bill restricts certain shareholder proposals, particularly those related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues, to prevent them from overshadowing business performance.

5. **Proxy Advisory Firms Regulation**: These firms must register with the SEC and adhere to new standards for transparency and accountability, including managing conflicts of interest.

6. **Liability for Misstatements**: Companies and advisory firms will be held accountable for failing to disclose material information or making false statements, ensuring investors receive accurate information.

7. **Empowering Shareholders**: The bill enhances shareholder influence, especially in passively managed funds, by setting proxy voting requirements that prioritize economic interests.

8. **Protecting Retail Investors**: It emphasizes that investment decisions should be based on financial factors, not political or social considerations, to protect retail investors.

9. **U.S. Business Sovereignty**: A study will be conducted on the impact of international corporate sustainability directives on U.S. businesses to protect domestic interests.

10. **Exclusion of ESG Proposals**: Companies can exclude ESG-related proposals from proxy materials to focus on economic performance.

11. **Corporate Governance Examination**: A study will be conducted to improve corporate governance practices by examining shareholder proposals and the proxy process.

12. **Proxy Voting and Shareholder Empowerment**: The bill prohibits automatic voting based on proxy advisory firm recommendations without independent analysis and ensures fiduciary responsibility in voting decisions.

13. **Investment Advisers and Proxy Voting**: Advisers must follow specific voting protocols, with protections from liability when doing so.

14. **Protecting Retail Investors' Savings**: Financial advisors must prioritize financial benefits for retail investors, using pecuniary factors unless otherwise consented.

15. **SEC Studies and Reporting**: The SEC will study and report on climate and environmental disclosures by municipal securities issuers and evaluate rules affecting small and minority-owned businesses.

16. **American FIRST Act of 2023**: This component ensures banking regulators are not unduly influenced by executive recommendations without congressional oversight and maintains national control over banking regulations.

Overall, the bill aims to streamline disclosure requirements, reduce regulatory burdens, and refocus corporate governance on material economic factors, while limiting the influence of non-material social and political issues in corporate decision-making. It seeks to enhance transparency, accountability, and shareholder empowerment in the U.S. financial landscape.
