# Bill Summary
The U.S. Congress is considering a resolution that encompasses several bills and a joint resolution, each targeting distinct areas of public policy. Here's a breakdown of the main objectives and provisions in straightforward terms:

1. **Higher Education Accreditation**: The bill aims to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to ensure that accrediting agencies cannot require political tests or infringe on constitutional rights as part of their accreditation criteria. This is intended to protect academic freedom and prevent political bias in higher education accreditation processes.

2. **Securities Disclosure**: Changes to federal securities laws are proposed to refine disclosure requirements, ensuring that companies provide material information that is truly significant to investors. Additionally, a Public Company Advisory Committee would be established to offer guidance on these matters.

3. **Country of Origin Markings**: This provision mandates that goods imported from the West Bank or Gaza must maintain clear country of origin markings. This is likely aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer awareness regarding the origins of these products.

4. **Retirement Security**: The bill seeks to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to clarify how financial and non-financial factors should be considered in retirement plans. This could impact how retirement funds are managed and invested, potentially affecting the financial security of retirees.

5. **Sanctuary Jurisdictions**: The legislation proposes that jurisdictions providing benefits to undocumented immigrants would be ineligible for certain federal funds. This is designed to discourage local policies that offer sanctuary to undocumented individuals by leveraging federal funding.

6. **Immigration and Nationality Act**: Amendments to this act would make individuals convicted of sex offenses or domestic violence inadmissible to the U.S. and subject to deportation. This aims to enhance public safety by tightening immigration controls on individuals with serious criminal convictions.

7. **Environmental Regulations**: A joint resolution seeks congressional disapproval of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule concerning emissions standards for vehicles from model years 2027 and beyond. This reflects a legislative check on regulatory actions that may impact environmental and automotive industry standards.

Each of these legislative items is subject to specific procedural rules in Congress, including debate, amendments, and motions, with certain procedural objections waived to facilitate their consideration.
