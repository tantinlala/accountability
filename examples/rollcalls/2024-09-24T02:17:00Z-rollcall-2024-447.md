# Bill Summary
The "Next Generation Pipelines Research and Development Act" is a legislative initiative designed to foster innovation and modernization in the U.S. pipeline infrastructure through enhanced public-private partnerships and federal research efforts. The bill primarily focuses on developing advanced pipeline systems that are safer, more efficient, and environmentally sustainable.

### Main Objectives and Provisions:

1. **Public-Private Collaboration**: The bill encourages collaboration between government entities, private companies, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations to drive innovation in pipeline technology.

2. **Research and Development**: It emphasizes federal research and development efforts to advance pipeline materials and technologies. This includes projects on advanced leak detection, novel materials, retrofitting technologies, and cybersecurity, among others.

3. **Demonstration Initiatives**: The bill establishes a demonstration initiative to fund projects that test and validate new pipeline technologies in real-world settings. This initiative aims to support projects with low to mid-technology readiness levels, focusing on regional and technological diversity and environmental impact reduction.

4. **Joint Research and Development Program**: A collaborative program involving the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is set up to develop and commercialize advanced pipeline technologies. This program will coordinate efforts across agencies to avoid duplication and manage cost-sharing.

5. **National Pipeline Modernization Center**: The bill proposes the creation of a center dedicated to research, development, and demonstration projects for commercializing cost-effective pipeline solutions. This center will work closely with industry stakeholders and prioritize existing higher education research centers.

6. **NIST Pipeline Metrology Program**: NIST will conduct research and standardization activities to ensure pipeline integrity and support safety and efficiency. This includes collaboration with the Department of Transportation and international standards organizations.

7. **Funding and Appropriations**: The bill authorizes specific funding allocations for these initiatives, with a total of $45 million for fiscal year 2025 and $50 million annually from 2026 to 2029. Additional funds are designated for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.

8. **Coordination and Standards**: The bill mandates coordination among various federal agencies and the development of technical standards to guide future pipeline infrastructure policies.

Overall, the "Next Generation Pipelines Research and Development Act" aims to modernize the U.S. pipeline infrastructure by leveraging cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaboration across sectors, ultimately enhancing safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.
