# Amendment Summary
An amendment numbered 1 printed in Part B of House Report 118-656 to offer a statement of policy in support of Taiwan's full participation at the World Health Organization.

# Bill Summary
The "No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act" is a proposed U.S. legislative bill that aims to ensure that any international agreements related to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), must be ratified by the U.S. Senate before they can be legally binding in the United States. This bill underscores the importance of the constitutional treaty-making process, which involves negotiation by the President and requires the Senate's advice and consent, with a two-thirds majority needed for ratification.

Key objectives and provisions of the bill include:

1. **Senate Ratification Requirement**: The bill mandates that any WHO agreements on pandemic issues must be treated as treaties, necessitating Senate approval. This ensures that such agreements align with U.S. laws and interests and maintain the balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches.

2. **Support for Taiwan**: The bill expresses U.S. policy support for Taiwan's full participation in the WHO, highlighting a commitment to inclusive global health governance.

3. **Public Skepticism and WHO's Independence**: The bill acknowledges significant public skepticism towards the WHO, particularly regarding its leadership and perceived political influences, especially from China. This skepticism underlines the need for Senate oversight.

4. **Legal Status and Implementation**: Until ratified by the Senate, any international treaty related to pandemics cannot be used in U.S. courts to establish legal standing or assess the legality of federal actions. This provision ensures that unratified treaties do not affect U.S. law or agency actions.

5. **No Implementation Without Ratification**: The bill explicitly states that no treaty will have any legal effect in the U.S. until it is ratified by the Senate, reinforcing the necessity of Senate consent for international agreements to be enforceable.

Overall, the bill seeks to reinforce the constitutional role of the Senate in treaty-making, address public concerns about WHO's independence, and ensure that any international commitments on pandemic preparedness are thoroughly vetted and approved by U.S. lawmakers.
