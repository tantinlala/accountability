# Bill Summary
The BIOSECURE Act is a legislative measure aimed at enhancing national security by regulating how the U.S. government engages with biotechnology companies. The primary goal of the bill is to prevent the government from entering into contracts with certain biotechnology providers that are considered security risks. Here's a breakdown of the main objectives and provisions of the bill in simple terms:

1. **Restricting Government Contracts**: The bill stops U.S. government agencies from buying biotechnology equipment or services from companies that are identified as potential security threats. This restriction also applies to any loans or grants involving these companies.

2. **Implementation Timeline**: The restrictions will start either 60 or 180 days after the necessary regulations are issued, depending on the type of company involved.

3. **Exceptions and Waivers**: There are some exceptions to these rules. For example, waivers can be granted for specific cases, especially for healthcare services provided overseas. Intelligence activities and certain healthcare services for U.S. employees abroad are also exempt.

4. **Identifying Risky Companies**: A list of biotechnology companies that pose national security risks will be created and regularly updated. Companies are evaluated based on their connections to foreign adversaries and the potential threat they pose to U.S. security.

5. **Assessing National Security Risks**: The bill requires an assessment of the risks associated with foreign adversaries gaining access to U.S. multiomic data (complex biological data). A report on these risks must be submitted to Congress.

6. **Regulatory Changes**: The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which governs how the government acquires goods and services, will be updated to reflect these new requirements.

7. **Annual Reporting**: The bill mandates annual reports on any suspicious activities by biotechnology companies that handle human multiomic data.

8. **No Extra Funding**: The bill specifies that no additional government funds will be allocated to implement these measures.

Overall, the BIOSECURE Act is focused on safeguarding U.S. national security by carefully controlling which biotechnology companies the government can work with, ensuring that only those meeting strict security standards are eligible for contracts.
