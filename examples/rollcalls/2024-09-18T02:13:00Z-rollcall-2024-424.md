# Bill Summary
The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2024, or the Autism CARES Act of 2024 (H.R. 7213), is a legislative effort aimed at improving the understanding, treatment, and support for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The bill seeks to amend the Public Health Service Act to bolster the activities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and reauthorize key programs related to autism through 2029. Here are the main objectives and provisions of the bill in straightforward terms:

1. **Enhanced Research Efforts**: The bill directs the NIH to expand and intensify research on autism, covering areas like genetics, neurobiology, and psychology. This includes both basic and clinical research, as well as studies on interventions to improve outcomes for individuals with ASD. The research will explore causes, diagnosis, detection, prevention, and treatment of ASD, including environmental factors and co-occurring conditions.

2. **Centers of Excellence**: At least six Centers of Excellence will be established to focus on comprehensive ASD research, including gerontology, to ensure a holistic approach to prevention, services, and treatment.

3. **Public Engagement**: The NIH is required to facilitate public access to information on ASD programs and activities, solicit public comments, and encourage the formation of external advisory boards. This ensures diverse representation in research, including input from individuals with ASD and their families.

4. **Support Services**: The bill aims to develop and expand support services for individuals with autism and their families, ensuring they have access to necessary resources and assistance.

5. **Public Awareness and Education**: Efforts will be made to increase public awareness and education about autism to foster understanding and acceptance within communities.

6. **Training for Professionals**: Training programs will be provided for healthcare providers, educators, and other professionals to improve the quality of care and support for individuals with autism.

7. **Collaboration and Coordination**: The bill encourages collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private organizations, to coordinate efforts and share information related to autism programs and services.

8. **Surveillance and Research Extension**: The Developmental Disabilities Surveillance and Research Program will be extended to 2029, with an expanded focus on life course studies.

9. **Education and Intervention**: The bill promotes culturally and linguistically responsive information, community-based participatory research, and improved screening and diagnostic tools for autism education, early detection, and intervention.

10. **Interagency Coordination and Reporting**: The strategic plan for ASD research and services will be updated to avoid duplication of efforts across federal agencies, with annual updates provided to Congress and the President. Progress reports on ASD activities will focus on young adults transitioning to adulthood, and a professional judgment budget for ASD-related activities will be required.

11. **Increased Funding**: The bill authorizes increased appropriations for ASD-related activities for fiscal years 2025 through 2029.

Overall, the Autism CARES Act of 2024 aims to enhance research, education, training, and services for individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities, ensuring cultural and linguistic inclusivity and increasing federal support and coordination.
