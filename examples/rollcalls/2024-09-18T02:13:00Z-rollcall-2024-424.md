# Bill Summary
The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2024, or the Autism CARES Act of 2024 (H.R. 7213), is a legislative effort aimed at improving the understanding, treatment, and support for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The bill seeks to amend the Public Health Service Act to bolster the activities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and reauthorize various programs related to ASD. Here’s a breakdown of the main objectives and provisions of the bill in straightforward terms:

1. **Enhanced Research Efforts**: The bill directs the NIH to expand and intensify research on ASD. This includes exploring the causes, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, and treatment of autism. The research will cover a broad spectrum of fields such as genetics, neurobiology, and psychology, and will also look into environmental factors and co-occurring conditions. The aim is to improve outcomes for individuals with ASD through both basic and clinical research.

2. **Centers of Excellence**: At least six Centers of Excellence will be established to focus on ASD. These centers will broaden the scope of research to include areas like gerontology and will ensure comprehensive approaches to service and treatment.

3. **Public Engagement and Input**: The bill emphasizes the importance of public involvement by requiring the NIH to facilitate access to information on ASD programs and activities. It encourages the formation of external advisory boards and seeks input from individuals with ASD and their families to ensure diverse representation in research.

4. **Support Services and Education**: The legislation aims to develop and expand support services for individuals with autism and their families, ensuring they have access to necessary resources. It also seeks to increase public awareness and education about autism to foster understanding and acceptance within communities.

5. **Training for Professionals**: Training programs will be provided for healthcare providers, educators, and other professionals to enhance the quality of care and support for individuals with autism.

6. **Collaboration and Coordination**: The bill encourages collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private organizations, to coordinate efforts and share information related to autism programs and services.

7. **Surveillance and Research Extension**: The Developmental Disabilities Surveillance and Research Program will be extended to 2029, with an expanded focus on life course studies.

8. **Cultural and Linguistic Inclusivity**: The bill promotes culturally and linguistically responsive information and services, ensuring that education, early detection, and intervention efforts are inclusive.

9. **Interagency Coordination and Reporting**: The strategic plan for ASD research and services will be updated to avoid duplication of efforts across federal agencies. Annual updates will be provided to Congress and the President, including progress reports on ASD activities and a focus on young adults transitioning to adulthood.

10. **Increased Funding**: The bill authorizes increased funding for ASD-related programs for fiscal years 2025 through 2029.

Overall, the Autism CARES Act of 2024 aims to enhance research, education, training, and services for individuals with ASD and other developmental disabilities, while ensuring cultural and linguistic inclusivity and increasing federal support and coordination.
