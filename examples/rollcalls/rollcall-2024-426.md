# Bill Summary
The "Protecting Americans' Investments from Woke Policies Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at amending the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to ensure that retirement investment decisions prioritize financial returns over non-financial considerations. Here's a breakdown of the bill's main objectives and provisions in straightforward terms:

1. **Prioritizing Financial Returns**: The bill mandates that those managing retirement plans (fiduciaries) focus on financial factors that are expected to impact investment risk or return. Non-financial goals, such as social or environmental considerations, should not compromise financial returns. However, if financial factors alone do not differentiate investment options, non-financial factors can be considered, provided they are documented and align with the financial interests of plan participants.

2. **Non-Discrimination in Retirement Plans**: The bill ensures that the selection and management of fiduciaries and service providers for retirement plans are free from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

3. **Protection of Shareholder Rights**: Fiduciaries are required to manage shareholder rights, such as proxy voting, with a focus on the economic interests of the retirement plan participants. They are not obligated to vote on every issue but must prioritize financial considerations and maintain records of their decisions.

4. **Transparency and Information Disclosure**: The bill enhances transparency for retirement investors by requiring detailed disclosures about investment options, particularly those not selected or monitored by fiduciaries. Participants must be informed of potential risks, fees, and returns associated with these options.

5. **Retirement Balance Projections**: Participants will receive projections of their retirement balances at age 67, assuming different annual return rates, to help them better understand potential future outcomes.

6. **Implementation Timeline**: The changes related to fiduciary responsibilities and shareholder rights will take effect on January 1, 2024, while the retirement balance projection requirements will be implemented starting January 1, 2025.

Overall, the bill seeks to ensure that retirement investments are managed with a primary focus on financial returns, while also promoting transparency and non-discrimination in the management of retirement plans.
