# Bill Summary
The "Find and Protect Foster Youth Act" is a legislative effort aimed at improving the safety and welfare of children in foster care, particularly those who go missing or are at risk of sex trafficking. The bill proposes amendments to part E of title IV of the Social Security Act, focusing on several key objectives and provisions:

1. **Identification and Response Improvement**: The bill mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify and address obstacles that hinder the effective recognition and response to reports of missing children from foster care. This includes evaluating state and tribal protocols to ensure they are effective and compliant.

2. **Technical Assistance and Best Practices**: The Secretary is tasked with providing technical assistance to states, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and consortia. This assistance includes offering information, advice, educational materials, and tools to help these entities overcome challenges in tracking and recovering missing children. The sharing of best practices is also emphasized to enhance the protection of foster youth.

3. **Screening and Support for At-Risk Children**: The bill highlights the need for robust screening processes to identify children who return to foster care after being missing, particularly those at risk of or being victims of sex trafficking. It calls for documenting these assessments and determining appropriate services for the identified children.

4. **Policy Development and Oversight**: Assistance will be provided to help develop oversight mechanisms and policies to ensure effective use of screening tools and compliance with legal requirements. This includes using collected data for oversight and compliance purposes.

5. **Expert Consultation**: The Secretary is encouraged to consult with experts on sex trafficking to effectively develop and disseminate the required assistance.

6. **Reporting to Congress**: A report detailing the evaluation of protocols, assistance efforts, and best practices is to be submitted to Congress within five years, ensuring accountability and progress tracking.

Overall, the "Find and Protect Foster Youth Act" seeks to enhance the processes and systems in place to protect vulnerable foster children, ensuring their safety and well-being through improved identification, response, and support mechanisms.
