# Bill Summary
The "Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2023" is a legislative effort to amend the Social Security Act, specifically targeting the windfall elimination provision, which affects how Social Security benefits are calculated for individuals with earnings from noncovered employment, such as certain government jobs. The bill aims to ensure fairer treatment and more equitable benefit calculations for these individuals. Here are the main objectives and provisions of the bill in straightforward terms:

1. **New Benefit Calculation Method**: The bill introduces a new formula for calculating Social Security benefits for people who become eligible for old-age or disability benefits after 2067 and have earnings from noncovered jobs after 1977. This new method will consider these noncovered earnings as part of the individual's average monthly earnings, which are used to determine their benefits.

2. **Inclusion of Noncovered Earnings**: It defines how noncovered earnings will be recorded and included in the benefit calculation, provided there is satisfactory evidence of these earnings in the Social Security Commissioner's records.

3. **Regulatory Guidance**: The Commissioner of Social Security is tasked with creating regulations to determine what constitutes satisfactory evidence of noncovered earnings.

4. **Posthumous Recalculation**: If an individual passes away, their benefits will be recalculated using the original method, ensuring no disadvantage due to the new calculation method.

5. **Foreign Payments**: For individuals receiving foreign payments based on noncovered service, their benefits will be recalculated under existing rules.

6. **Conforming Amendments**: The bill updates existing clauses to align with the new provisions and limits certain clauses to individuals eligible before 2068.

7. **Effective Date**: The changes will apply to benefits starting January 1, 2025.

8. **Transition Period Adjustments**: For those eligible for benefits between 2025 and 2068, the bill ensures they receive the higher of two possible benefit amounts, providing a safety net during the transition to the new calculation method.

9. **Additional Monthly Payments**: The bill mandates additional monthly payments of $100 to eligible individuals and $50 to others receiving benefits based on the eligible individual's earnings. These payments are protected from reductions and will be adjusted for inflation.

10. **Social Security Account Statements**: The bill requires that Social Security account statements include earnings from non-employment service after 1977, excluding military service, starting January 1, 2025.

11. **Study on Data Sharing**: The bill calls for a study on the feasibility of collaborating with state and local pension systems to improve data collection on noncovered pensions. This includes exploring automated data exchanges and identifying barriers to implementation, with a report due to Congress within 4.5 years.

Overall, the bill seeks to modernize and make the Social Security benefit calculation process more equitable for public servants with noncovered employment, while also enhancing data accuracy and transparency.
