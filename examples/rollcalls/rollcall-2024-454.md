# Bill Summary
The "Keeping Violent Offenders Off Our Streets Act" is a proposed law designed to improve public safety by tightening the rules around the bail process. The main goal of the bill is to prevent fraud when it comes to posting bail, which is the money or bond paid to release someone from jail while they await trial. This includes all types of bail, such as monetary bail, criminal bail bonds, and federal immigration bail bonds. By making it illegal to commit fraud in these situations, the bill aims to ensure that violent offenders cannot exploit loopholes or deceptive practices to gain their freedom before their trial. In simple terms, the bill seeks to keep communities safer by making sure that those who pose a threat cannot easily get out of jail through dishonest means.
