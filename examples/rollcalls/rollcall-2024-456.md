# Bill Summary
The "Social Security Fairness Act of 2023" is a proposed law designed to change how Social Security benefits are calculated for people who also receive government pensions. Specifically, it seeks to eliminate two rules: the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). 

These rules have historically reduced Social Security benefits for individuals who worked in jobs not covered by Social Security, such as certain government positions, and who also receive a pension from that work. The GPO could reduce spousal or survivor benefits, while the WEP could lower retirement or disability benefits.

By repealing these provisions, the bill aims to ensure that people who have government pensions receive their full Social Security benefits without reductions. The changes would take effect for benefits paid after December 2023. The Social Security Administration will adjust benefit calculations to align with these new rules, ensuring that the transition is smooth and consistent with the rest of the Social Security Act.
