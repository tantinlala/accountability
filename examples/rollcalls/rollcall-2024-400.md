# Bill Summary
The bill in question, H. Res. 1371 of the 118th Congress, is a House Resolution that primarily serves as a formal expression of the House of Representatives' stance on the current administration's handling of border security and immigration issues. While House Resolutions are typically non-binding and do not have the force of law, they are used to express opinions or make internal rules.

The main objectives of this resolution are to criticize the Biden administration, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris, for their management of illegal immigration and border security. The resolution points out several key issues:

1. **Increase in Illegal Immigration**: It notes a significant rise in illegal immigrant encounters since the current administration took office.

2. **Communication Gaps**: The resolution criticizes the lack of effective communication with Border Patrol leadership.

3. **Security Concerns**: It raises alarms about the release of individuals with criminal and terrorist ties into the United States.

4. **Policy Criticism**: The resolution attributes the border crisis to specific policies of the administration, such as the termination of the "Remain in Mexico" program.

5. **Financial Impact**: It highlights the financial burden these policies place on taxpayers.

6. **Call for Competent Leadership**: The House of Representatives calls for officials who have a better understanding of the border crisis and warns that continuing the current policies could be harmful to the country.

Overall, the resolution serves as a formal condemnation of the administration's border security policies and emphasizes the need for a change in approach to address the ongoing issues effectively.
