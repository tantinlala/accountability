6. **Removal of Noncitizens**: States are required to remove noncitizens from voter rolls upon verification of their status.

7. **Penalties and Enforcement**: Introduces penalties for officials who register noncitizens and provides a private right of action for violations.

8. **Election Assistance Commission Guidance**: Within 10 days of enactment, the Commission must guide state election officials on implementing the amended National Voter Registration Act.

9. **Exemption from Paperwork Reduction Act**: Voter registration materials are exempt from these requirements.

10. **Notification of Naturalization**: The Secretary of Homeland Security must notify state election officials when someone becomes a naturalized citizen.
