An amendment numbered 1 printed in Part B of House Report 118-705 to add to the sanction list under section 4 any Chinese State-Owned Enterprise that knowingly manufactures or distributes any chemicals used in the production of illicit fentanyl.

# Bill Summary
The "Sanctioning Tyrannical and Oppressive People within the Chinese Communist Party Act" (STOP CCP Act) is a U.S. legislative measure aimed at addressing and penalizing actions by members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that are considered tyrannical and oppressive. The bill focuses on several key areas of concern related to U.S. foreign policy and human rights issues:

1. **Hong Kong Autonomy**: The bill criticizes China's imposition of the Hong Kong National Security Law, which is seen as a violation of Hong Kong's Basic Law and international commitments. This law undermines the "one country, two systems" principle, affecting global confidence in China's adherence to international law.

2. **Human Rights in Xinjiang**: The bill highlights severe human rights abuses against ethnic Muslim minorities, particularly the Uyghurs, in the Xinjiang region. These abuses include forced sterilizations and abortions, which the U.S. Department of State has labeled as crimes against humanity and genocide. The bill notes international condemnation of these actions.

3. **Taiwan Relations**: The bill reaffirms U.S. support for Taiwan's security and stability, emphasizing the importance of a peaceful resolution regarding Taiwan's future. It expresses concern over China's military provocations and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan.

The STOP CCP Act mandates the U.S. President to impose sanctions on individuals and entities associated with the CCP and Chinese state-owned enterprises involved in activities such as violating Hong Kong's autonomy, aggression towards Taiwan, human rights abuses in China, and interference in U.S. elections. Sanctions include blocking property transactions and imposing visa restrictions. However, exceptions are made for U.N. obligations and U.S. national security activities. The President can waive sanctions for national security reasons and terminate them if China ceases certain oppressive actions or if sanctioned individuals renounce CCP membership and remediate their conduct. The bill does not impose sanctions on the importation of goods and specifies the relevant congressional committees involved.

Overall, the STOP CCP Act aims to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its actions in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Taiwan, while reinforcing U.S. support for human rights and democratic governance.
