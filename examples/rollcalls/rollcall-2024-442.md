# Bill Summary
The "United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2024" is a legislative proposal designed to continue the work of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). This bill seeks to ensure that the commission, which plays a crucial role in monitoring and advocating for religious freedom around the world, remains operational and funded for the next few years. Specifically, it amends the existing International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to authorize funding for the commission through the fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Additionally, it extends the commission's mandate to operate until September 30, 2026. In simple terms, this bill is about keeping the USCIRF active and financially supported so it can continue its important work in promoting and protecting religious freedom globally.
