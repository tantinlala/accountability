# Bill Summary
The "Protect America's Innovation and Economic Security from CCP Act of 2024" (H.R. 1398) is a legislative effort designed to protect U.S. innovation and economic interests from potential threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The bill establishes the CCP Initiative within the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. This initiative focuses on several key areas:

1. **Intellectual Property Protection**: The bill aims to curb espionage activities targeting U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions, ensuring that American innovations are safeguarded from unauthorized access and theft.

2. **Cybersecurity Enhancement**: It emphasizes the need to bolster cybersecurity measures to protect against hacking and economic espionage, particularly those linked to the CCP.

3. **Economic Integrity**: The initiative seeks to ensure the integrity of U.S. economic activities by developing strategies to counter nontraditional technology collectors and implementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act. This includes scrutinizing investments by Chinese companies that may pose risks to national security.

4. **Legal Enforcement**: The bill prioritizes the prosecution of trade secret theft and other related crimes. It also involves identifying and addressing cases under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that involve Chinese companies.

5. **Coordination and Reporting**: The Attorney General will coordinate with the FBI and other agencies to ensure the initiative is distinct and well-resourced. An annual report will be submitted to Congress detailing the initiative's progress, resource adequacy, and its impact on CCP activities.

The act is set to be effective for six years from its enactment and includes a severability clause to maintain its effectiveness even if parts are deemed unconstitutional. Overall, the bill represents a comprehensive approach to protecting U.S. economic and innovation interests from foreign threats, particularly those associated with the CCP.
