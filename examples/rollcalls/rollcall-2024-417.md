# Bill Summary
The "End Chinese Dominance of Electric Vehicles in America Act of 2024" is a legislative effort aimed at reducing the United States' reliance on foreign materials, particularly from countries considered as prohibited entities, in the production of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The bill seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by altering the criteria for vehicles to qualify for the clean vehicle tax credit.

Under this bill, vehicles will no longer be eligible for the clean vehicle credit if their batteries contain components or materials that are extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by entities deemed as prohibited foreign entities. Additionally, vehicles with batteries designed or manufactured through processes linked to agreements with these prohibited entities, where the contract cost exceeds $5 million, will also be disqualified from receiving the credit.

A "prohibited foreign entity" is defined as any foreign entity of concern, those influenced by a government of a covered nation, or entities with significant ownership by covered nations or their citizens. This legislative change applies to vehicles placed in service after the enactment of the Act.

The primary goal of this bill is to encourage the use of domestically sourced materials in EV battery production, thereby enhancing national security and promoting economic independence in the growing electric vehicle market.
