# Bill Summary
The "Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) Certification Act" is a legislative proposal aimed at reassessing and potentially revoking the special privileges and immunities granted to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) in the United States. This bill is a response to concerns about Hong Kong's diminishing autonomy from the People's Republic of China.

**Main Objectives and Provisions:**

1. **Certification Requirement:** The President of the United States is tasked with regularly certifying to Congress whether the HKETOs should continue to receive certain privileges. This certification must occur within 30 days of the bill's enactment and then regularly thereafter.

2. **Revocation of Privileges:** If the President determines that Hong Kong no longer maintains a high degree of autonomy, the privileges granted to the HKETOs will be revoked, and they must cease operations within 180 days. The President can also revoke these privileges at any time.

3. **Congressional Oversight:** Congress has a 90-day window to disapprove the President's certification through a resolution. This process ensures that Congress has a say in whether the HKETOs should continue to operate under the current privileges.

4. **Contracting Restrictions:** The bill imposes restrictions on U.S. government entities from entering into agreements or partnerships with the HKETOs unless certified that such agreements do not support efforts by Hong Kong or China to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, rule of law, or human rights.

5. **Promotion and Propaganda:** The bill aims to prevent U.S. government entities from promoting Hong Kong as a free and autonomous city or its government as committed to human rights and the rule of law if the Secretary of State certifies that Hong Kong lacks autonomy from China. This is to avoid supporting what is considered Chinese propaganda.

6. **Advocacy for Human Rights:** The bill encourages engagement with Hong Kong's government to advocate for the release of political prisoners, end arbitrary detentions, resume a free press, ensure fair elections, and restore an independent judiciary.

In essence, the bill seeks to hold Hong Kong accountable for its autonomy and human rights practices by leveraging the privileges of its economic and trade offices in the U.S. It establishes a framework for regular review and potential revocation of these privileges, with significant input from both the President and Congress.
