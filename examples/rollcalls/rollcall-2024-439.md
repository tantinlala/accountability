# Bill Summary
The "Enhanced Presidential Security Act of 2024" is designed to improve the safety and security of key political figures in the United States. The main goals of the bill are to ensure that there are clear and consistent standards for how many Secret Service agents are needed to protect current and former Presidents, Vice Presidents, and major candidates for these offices. To achieve this, the bill requires the Director of the United States Secret Service to establish these standards and conduct a thorough review of the current protection services. This review will look at how well the Secret Service is doing its job and suggest any necessary improvements. The findings and recommendations from this review must be reported to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees within 180 days after the bill becomes law. Additionally, the bill provides a clear definition of what constitutes a "major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate" to ensure that the right individuals receive the necessary protection.
