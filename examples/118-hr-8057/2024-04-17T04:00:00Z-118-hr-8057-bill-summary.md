The bill H.R. 8057 proposes to rename the United States Postal Service facility at 9317 Bolsa Avenue in Westminster, California, as the "Little Saigon Vietnam War Veterans Memorial Post Office." The main goal of this bill is to pay tribute to Vietnam War veterans by officially recognizing their service and sacrifice through the renaming of this postal facility. Once enacted, all official U.S. documents will refer to this location by its new name, ensuring that the contributions of these veterans are honored and remembered in the community.
